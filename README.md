# CryptoClustering

The data was first scaled for easier interpretation using the StandardScaler. Then the KMeans model was used to determine the optimal k value. The data was then clustered based on this optimal k value. Once that was completed, PCA was run and then the same process of optimizing k and clustering took place with the PCA data. The graphs associated with each data set was compared and contrasted to see the effect of PCA
